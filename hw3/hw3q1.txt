(B) break 15
    break factorial(int)

(C) 1.) The bug was that the int i was set to start at 0 and anything multiplied by zero will always be zero.
    2.) The sequence of commands I used to debugare: break 15, break factoral, r, n, print i, n, print num, print i, n, print i, print num, n, print i, print n, q.

(D) 1.) The bug in factorial() is that the variable num was being used and changed through-out the loop. To fix this we have to add a new variable and we initialize that variable to start 1.
    2.) The sequence of commands I used to debug are: break 15, break factoral, r, n , n, print num, n, print num, print i, n, print num, n, print num, n, print num, n, print num, print i, n, print n, q.
