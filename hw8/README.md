###hw8

Steps to run:
 + To complile all of hw8, just type "make" on compiler
 + To my test for timing on quicksort, just run "./hw8q2a" and this would ask you to input an array size you desire.
 + To view the plot, just double click on "hw8q3b.jpg" or if you have sublime, you can run "subl hw8q3b.txt" and this will open the .jpg on sublime.
 + To run hw8q3, to type "./hw8q3 data.txt output.txt" where data.txt is the input file with the data, and output.txt is the output text file that we wish to write on.
 + To test heap, type "./hw8q4" and it will ask you for the number of nodes.
 + See hw8q5.jpg for plots and hw8q5.txt for reasoning.
